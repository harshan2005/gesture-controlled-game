# 🍉 Gesture Fruit Ninja

A fun and simple game where you slice fruits in the air using your **hand gestures** — no keyboard, no mouse, just your webcam!


## ✨ What Is This?

This is a basic version of the popular *Fruit Ninja* game, built with Python.  
But instead of using a finger on a screen, you just wave your real hand in front of your webcam to slice the fruit! 🎮🖐️

## 📸 How It Works

->Uses your **webcam** to detect your hand with **MediaPipe**.
->Tracks your fingertip and checks if it's moving fast (a "swipe").
->If your finger swipes through a fruit — boom! It gets sliced. 🍓
->You earn points for each fruit sliced.


## 🧱 Tech Used
